This is a refresh structuring of AAP-JUCE sample builders.

`aap-juce` subdirectory right now contains files directly, but they are going to be the actual `aap-juce` repository contents.

This repository on the other hand contains sample projects that have submodules of the imported projects respectively, which might contain JUCE as a huge dependency.
